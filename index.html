<h1>This is a website made with only h tags!</h1>
<h2>You can write your thoughts here</h2>
<h3>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h3>
<h4>Like Atlanta traffic, for example</h4>
<h5>I mean, like why are there two accidents a day on the highway stopping all of rush-hour traffic for hours?</h5>
<h6>Can we have less people in Atlanta? I mean honestly...</h6>
